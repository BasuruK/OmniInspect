                        Think before executing and plan the steps ahead before executing. 
                        List down all the steps you need to follow and follow one by one and Mark ✅ at the end of each step after successful execution. IF Fails, mark it with ❌ and inspect the reason and inform the user. 
                        And you are to follow the below steps. 

                        Steps to follow,
                        1. Download the following zip file using PowerShell URL: https://github.com/oracle/odpi/archive/refs/tags/v5.5.1.zip and Extract it using PowerShell and verify '/include' and '/src' directories are present in the extracted folder. 
                        Delete the zip file after extraction.
                        2. Verify 'include' and 'src' folders exists in '/internal/lib/' directory. if not create the missing folder.
                        3. Copy all the h (c header) files inside the extracted zip file's 'include' folder into '/internal/lib/odpi/include' folder.
                        4. Copy all the c (c files) files inside the extracted zip file's 'src' folder into '/internal/libodpi/src' folder.
                        5. Copy all the c (c files) files inside '/internal/lib/odpi/include' into '/internal/lib/odpi/src' folder.
                        7. Delete extracted folder from source directory.
                        8. Check if a Makefile is available inside '/internal/lib/odpi/' directory. If not create a new one. Verify SRC and OBJ paths are correctly allocated according to ODPI-C requirements. Make sure INSTANT_CLIENT_DIR is set to C:/oracle_inst/instantclient_23_7/sdk/lib/msvc [this is the oracle client installed path].
                        9. Makefile should create odpi.dll compiling the all the header and c files. And the odpi.dll must be copied to the main directory, same directory as 'main.go' file.
                        10. Makefile should clean the '/internal/lib/odpi/src/' and delete the '/internal/lib/odpi/src' folder after make operation is completed.
